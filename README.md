## Automatically Constructing a Geospatial Feature Taxonomy from OpenStreetMap Data

### _Note: This work is currently under review. The source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance of its accompanying paper._

The `osm-taxonomy` tool enables the automatic generation of a lightweight and structured taxonomy for geographic features using [OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) data. It leverages innovative algorithms and techniques to analyze OSM datasets and extract hierarchical relationships between tags, providing a comprehensive framework for categorizing and classifying various types of geospatial features. This tool streamlines the taxonomy construction process, addressing the limitations of unstructured tags, and offering a valuable resource for data organization, analysis, and understanding in the field of geospatial research.
